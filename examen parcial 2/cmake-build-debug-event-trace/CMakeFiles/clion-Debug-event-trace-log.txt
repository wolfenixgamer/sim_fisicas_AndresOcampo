CMake Error at C:/Users/xocam/.vcpkg-clion/vcpkg (1)/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake:859 (_find_package):
  By not providing "Findbox2d.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "box2d", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "box2d" with any of
  the following names:

    box2dConfig.cmake
    box2d-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "box2d" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "box2d_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "box2d"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
